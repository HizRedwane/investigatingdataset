In this project I will walk through the basic process of data analysis to analyse data related to information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil, this dataset is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 
Data is collected from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competition, you can get all the information about the problem and download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/),
