# Investigating Dataset
In this project I will analyze data related to information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil, this dataset is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. During this project, I will try to find different correlations between NoShow factor and other factors (see project report for more information).

# Research Questions:

Q1: Who missed the most scheduled appointments? Males or Females?

Q2: What is the relationship between the patient's age range and his commitment to the scheduled appointment?

Q3: Are the range time between the scheduled date and the date of the appointment correlated to the commitment of the patient?

Q4: How SMS_Received and NoShow factors are related?
